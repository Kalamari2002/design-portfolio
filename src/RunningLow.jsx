        description='Running Low is a game my brother and I developed for the 2021 Mini Jam, the theme being Power. 
        We thought that a game where the player is at a constant tug of war for resources would be a fitting entry for the whole "Power" 
        theme, so this is how we came with the concept for this project. We actually managed to finish this game before the deadline this 
        time lol and honestly I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s all thanks to the lesson we learned with the first version of Limbs. Out of 
        176 entries, our game managed to rank #5 for enjoyment and #14 overall, so we were very proud of this little game! I 
        absolutely loved animating the batteries. Normally I spend quite a bit of time worrying about drawing 
        each frame as consistently as possible (admittedly not a good habit for animation). Because the battery characters had a 
        very simple design, I could focus entirely on working on the fluidity and motion of each animation this time.'
