        description='Kitchen Diver is our entry for the 2023.2 Brackeys Game Jam, theme being "Diving Deeper".
        I distinctly remember talking to my brother what game we wanted to make, and we had all these serious
        ideas for Lovecraftian horror games but none really stuck to us that much. That is until my brother went
        "Hear me out: fish with a sword" and the rest is history. In many ways I think a diver is someone who, despite
        being completely out of their element, presses forward into an alien environment, and we liked the idea of
        having a fish be a diver in that sense. Controls for this one ended up being kinda wonky (especially playing
        on a tiny browser window) but I think the game has a lot of charm to it. Ended up placing #16 in the
        "Overall" category and 14th in the "Fun" category out of 910 entries, so I definitely think the grind was worth it.
        I also had a blast playing the games that other people made for this jam :)'
