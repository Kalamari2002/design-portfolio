        description='A Weird Boss Battle is a game my brother and I made for the Bear Jam of Fall 2021. The theme we 
        had to work with was "Inconsistent", so our idea was to make the player fight the same boss, but every time they would 
        spawn with a random weapon and perk (low gravity, speed up, color blindness, among others). This way, the player has to 
        not only memorize the boss&rsquo; patterns, but also adapt to the tools they are given, for better or worse. What I 
        enjoyed most in this project was experimenting with a different art direction from what I&rsquo;m comfortable with. 
        My go-to artstyle is pixel art, but this jam&rsquo;s theme gave me a pretty good excuse to go ham with a mixture of pixel 
        art and actual pictures to create something that looked "inconsistent". I really wanna come back to this artstyle in another 
        game, where I use collages to create some weird and uncanny characters...'
